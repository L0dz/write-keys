# write-keys
Python script that gets an input and then simulates the user writing that input.

I use this python script when I forget to record my coding. I simply run this script and record the screen.
Basically the script gets an input written by the user or from a txt file, then it lets you choose the delay between each letter to write.
After that, you have 10 seconds to put the cursor wherever you want the script to start and then... here's your text writing simulation.
You can even select the vs code mode, which is tested to work for html and css. An important thing to remember before using vs code mode is to go to 
File>Preferences>Settings>Extensions>HTML and disable auto-closing tags to avoid issues.
